# Batch/ offline learning:
- Way of training a model where we can use all data together to train a model.
- Training is done in lot and not is small parts.
- Training is done on an offline system and once the model is trained then model is deployed on server.
- If we train huge amount of data on server it would be costly and time consuming, insted we do batch learning.

DATA---->MODEL----->TEST---->SERVER

## Problem:
- Once trained it does not learn anything new.
- Works only on trained data.
- Business scenerio evolves but the trained model will be old.
- We have to retrain the model periodically.
