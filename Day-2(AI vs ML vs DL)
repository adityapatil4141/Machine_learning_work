Artificial Intelligence(AI):
- Making machines intelligent.
- In this we deal with pattern recognition(Ai stuff)

Machine Learning(ML):
- Statistical techinque used to find patterns from data.
- Rather than writing rules for everyting, just provide data and rules will be generated automatically.

Deep Learning(DL):
- Similar to machine learning no difference.
- Different algorithm.
- Inspired by human biology(neurons).
- Core unit perceptron is based on biological neuron.
- Used on big data.
- Machine learning is relatively used on small data.
