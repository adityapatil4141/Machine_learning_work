# Online learning:
- Online learning is done on server.
- In online learning we train model dynamically on server.
- As new data comes, performance of model increases.
- DATA -----> MODEL -----> TEST------> SERVER <---(NEW DATA)
- We do incremental learning, we train model sequentially (in mini batches)

## When to use:
- Where nature of problem changes.
- eg. stock exchange.
- Cost effective.
- Faster solution.

## Libraries:
- River.
- Vowpal wabbit.
