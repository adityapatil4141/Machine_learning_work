1. Frame the problem:
- To decide what exactly to do .
- Have to look on the cost, problem, what to solve, who is the customer,team required, supervised/unsupervised model etc.

2. Gathering Data:
- .CSV , API, Web Scrapping , DataWarehouse(ETL)

3. Data Preprocessing:
- We can get uncleaned data.
- Remove duplicate, missing values etc..

4. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
- Experiment on data.
- Finding hidden relationships between data.
- Univariate , Bivariate , Multivariate analysis.

5. Feature Engineering and selection:
- Feature = Input columns.
- Creating new columns which will simplify analysis.

6. Model Training, Evaluation and selection:
- Ensemble learning - combining ML models and making a new powerful algorithm/model.

7. Model Deployment:
- Pikle file
- We make a binary file from the model & convert it into an API.

8. Testing:
- Sending new feature to trusted customers to get feedback.
- Techinque used - A/B testing.
- If not good model , Repeat process again from start.

9. Optimize:
- Take back-up of the model,
- Take back-up of the data,
- Load balancing,
- Decide how frequently retrain to be done,
- To make entire process perfect.
